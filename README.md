Hurricane Harvey was a devastating Category 4 hurricane that made landfall on Texas and Louisiana in August 2017, causing catastrophic flooding and more than 100 deaths. It caused $125 billion in damage, according to the National Hurricane Center. That’s more than any other natural disaster in U.S. history except Hurricane Katrina.

A global rise in the occurrences of natural disasters and human-borne conflicts has put a spotlight on the need for Earth Observation (EO) data in designing practical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) interventions. Novel techniques that leverage remotely sensed data are leading to a paradigm shift in our understanding of such situations and improving the efficacy and timeliness of our response.

Aerial post-flood maps can provide localized insight into the extent of flood-related damage and the degree to which communities’ access to shelter, clean water, and communication channels have been compromised. Unfortunately, such insights typically only emerge hours or days after a flooding event has occurred. Moreover, a scarcity of available historical data restricts the development of practical machine learning-based methods.

In this challenge, we will be competing to develop an accurate dense segmentation model for aerial post-flood aerial imagery. We will work to identify property attributes in the Houston area following Hurricane Harvey in an effort to autonomously generate a post-flood map. We will leverage the provided drone image dataset in order to train segmentation models to better understand ground conditions after Hurricanes. Our goal is to accurately identify and segment common large and small assets in residential Houston after Hurricane Harvey that may or may not be damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
